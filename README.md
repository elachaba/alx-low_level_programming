# low_level_programming
In this repository, we work on the basic principales of coding with C.

## Hello_World:
  This is an initiation to coding with C, we try to understand how the compilation process
workes and familiarise with the syntax and standard library functions.

## If_Else_While
  This is the first contact with conditionals and loops in C. The use of standard library
here is limited, we rather use loops to print the string one character at a time to the
standard output.

## Functions_Nested_Loops
  We work on modular programming: organising the code into functions in order to make it
more readable, maintainable and less redundant.

## Debugging
  GDB is a very strong and important tool in C programming. We use it here to spot the issues
with the code and correct them.

## Pointers
  One special thing about is pointers. Pointers are crucial for dynamic memory management
functions like malloc(). Three projects here offer an initiating to the various uses of pointers,
and various types of them.

## Static_Library
  : Libraries allow developers to reuse code across multiple projects without rewriting it. In this
project we learn how libraries work and we create one using functions we have coded before.

## argc_argv
  This is a chance to work with programs that take input from the terminal.
